% Select the WAV file from browse option after running this code
%The actual frequency of WAV file will be shown in subplot
%If any deviation in the frequency shown in the subplot,which means there
%is a deviation in manufacturing process of tuning fork.
%Example here though 1024.wav is recorded from the tuning fork having 1024
%as a specification. In FFT spectrum it can be analized  that its producing
%frequency of 560-600Hz only ,hence it is the defect
%This is tested using Matlab2014A
